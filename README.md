This was more fun than I expected. Having the annotations go from floating elements to a stacked list was a challenge, but one I enjoyed completing. I've also attached a screenshot showing a slight different in how Figma and Chrome render text. In Chrome, it looks more like a font weight of 300 matches what Figma renders - but I kept it at 400 to match the element data in Figma instead.
